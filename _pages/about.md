Ivana Ljubić is Professor of Operations Research at the [ESSEC Business School](http://www.essec.edu/) of Paris. She received her habilitation in Operations Research at the University of Vienna (2013), and she holds PhD degree in computer science from the Vienna University of Technology (2004) and master's degree in mathematics from the University of Belgrade (2000). She worked for two years in a company dealing with portfolio optimization before continuing her university career at the University of Vienna where she was appointed until 2015. She was also Visiting Researcher/Professor at the following institutions: La Sapienza in Rome, University of Maryland, TU Berlin, TU Dortmund, University of Paris Dauphine, etc. As of September 2015, she is appointed at the [ESSEC Business School](http://www.essec.edu/) of Paris.

She is member of the Editorial Advisory Board for the journals European Journal of Operational Research, Computers and Operations Research, and she is Associate Editor for the journals Transportation Science and Networks. She also served as guest-editor of journals: European Journal of Operational Research and Annals of Operations Research and she is a former chair of the [INFORMS Telecommunication Section](https://www.informs.org/Community/Telecom).

Research interests of Ivana Ljubić include network design problems, combinatorial optimization, optimization under uncertainty, bilevel optimization. She uses tools and methods of mixed integer programming, (meta-)heuristics and their successful combinations for solving optimization problems with applications in telecommunications, design of data and distribution networks and bioinformatics.
She received PhD Fellowship of the [Austrian Academy of Sciences](http://www.oeaw.ac.at/en/austrian-academy-of-sciences/) (DOC Fellowship, 2003-2004), PhD award of the Austrian Society for Operations Research (2005), Hertha-Firnberg Post-Doc Fellowship of the [Austrian Science Fund](http://www.fwf.ac.at/) (2007-2010) and APART Fellowship of the [Austrian Academy of Sciences](http://www.oeaw.ac.at/en/austrian-academy-of-sciences/) (2011-2013).
